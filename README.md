Hello, so this repository basically showcases my work on all the console-based projects that were assigned to me under my CodSoft Internship of C++ Programming.

There are 5 tasks in total that I successfully completed, namely -

1. TASK 1 (NUMBER GUESSING GAME) - For this, I included cstdlib, ctime libraries and used srand(), rand() functions to generate a random number which is to be guessed by the user.
2. TASK 2 (SIMPLE CALCULATOR) - For this, I used switch case.
3. TASK 3 (TIC-TAC-TOE GAME) - For this, I used functions, arrays etc.
4. TASK 4 (TO-DO LIST) - For this, I used switch case and arrays etc.
5. TASK 5 (LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) - For this, I used the concept of OOPS (classes and objects).

Thus, while creating each project, I got to learn and revise all my concepts with full passion and dedication, which helped me grow as a programmer (developer), fulfilling the
purpose of this internship.

So, in conclusion, I'm highly thankful to CodSoft for giving me this amazing opportunity to help me improve my skills and grow.
